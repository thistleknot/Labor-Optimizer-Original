Description: Dwarf Therapist is an extension application for the game 
 Dwarf Fortress.  It is intended and designed to be primarily a decision 
 support tool to reduce or eliminate in-game screen transitions to find 
 information and present game data in a concise, flexible and 
 easy-to-understand manner.  Additionally, this program assists in otherwise 
 cumbersome or tedius workflows (such as changing labors assignments) and 
 allow quick, easy editing of these elements within DwarfTherapist and then 
 writing the changes to the game.
 .
 This package contains the Dwarf Therapist binary.
 . 
 The nature of this software requires that it be run with elevated privileges 
 on systems where ptrace attach has been hardened.  If you are uncomfortable 
 with this, it is advised you check back; future releases may have a sane 
 workaround for this issue.
