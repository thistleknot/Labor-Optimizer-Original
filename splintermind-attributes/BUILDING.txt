Detailed instructions for building DwarfTherapist are located on the Google Project Page:
http://code.google.com/p/dwarftherapist/wiki/BuildingDwarfTherapist

However, the short of it is as follows:

For Windows, download the QTCreator IDE and open the dwarftherapist.pro file.  You can build
from within QTCreator.

For Linux, either follow the Windows instructions above, or do the following:

# Install the qt4 dev tools.  You're on your own for non debian/apt systems
	> sudo apt-get install qt4-qmake qt4-dev-tools

#Checkout the project
	> hg clone https://dwarftherapist.googlecode.com/hg/ dwarftherapist

#Build the project
	> cd dwarftherapist
	> qmake
	> make
