 * - Migration Waves Incorrect -
   The group-by "Migration Wave" is based on some shady guesswork
   based on dwarf ids. It is in no way 100% accurate, but can sometimes amaze 
   me that it works :)
   
 * - Dwarf and Squad Names -
   This is brute force word-list searching. Verb conjugation, plurality and 
   case are a crapshoot. But it's generally pretty close.
  
 * - Unknown - 
   If you come across some other weird error, please post a bug report here:
