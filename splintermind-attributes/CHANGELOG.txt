      memory segment (it now finds all of them)
   3) There was no provision for hits that may cross step boundaries. Use of a 
      back buffer now catches matches across step boundaries.

RELEASE 0.5.2 (May 18, 2010)
CHANGES SINCE 0.5.1
===============================================================================
MAJOR CHANGES:
 * Support for 0.31.04
 * MemoryLayouts now have a concept of being "complete" or not. DT will not try
   to load values on startup if the detected layout file is "incomplete" 
   (complete means the file doesn't contain a "complete = false" line in its 
   [info] section. This should help for mapping new versions.
MINOR CHANGES:
 * Added a "copy address to clipboard" method to dwarf context menu
 * Added dump to file context menu action for dwarves (Fixes issue 224)
 * Greatly sped up raw data reads on linux (also uses less ram)

 * Sorting fix (fixes issue 220)
 * Fixed crash on right click in grid views dock (Fixes issue 219)


RELEASE 0.5.1 (April 24, 2010)
CHANGES SINCE 0.5.0
===============================================================================
MAJOR CHANGES:
 * Stable Support for 0.31.03
 * game_data.ini no longer lists checksum->memory_layout entries anymore 
   (They are now discovered by reading *.ini in your platform's memory_layout 
   directory) Any .ini file found with a valid info section will be added to 
   the memory layout list. This prevents repeating the same data in different 
   places and enables new layout files to be delivered in the future by just 
   dropping them in the correct directory.
 * The "can't talk to this version" warning dialog got a face lift. Since we now
   read in all memory layouts, the dialog can show which versions of DF can be 
   talked to. This hopefully gives a bit more actionble information to the user.
   It also links to the wiki.
MINOR CHANGES:
 * New group-by method "Highest Skill" groups dwarves by their highest actual skill level
 * New group-by method "Total Skill Levels" groups dwarves by their total number of skill ranks
 * Added a progress bar the Main windows's status bar (dwarf loading uses it now)
BUG FIXES:
 * Fix for leatherworking and tanning mixup on the grid
 * Fixed issue 206. (wrong name for skill level 2)
 * Fixed crash in Scanner if creature_vector is incorrect
 * Profession 63 is Diagnoser not Suturer (fixes issue 205)
 * Applied locale-aware sorting patch from Zhentar (fixes issue 190)
 * Some translation fixes for setting Dwarf nicknames.
 * Added new group by "Highest skill" option (Fixes issue 180)
 * Added method to group by total skill level (Related to issue 180)
 * Fix sorting for integer based group-by options (such as Highest skill, migration wave etc...)

 * MemoryLayout now checks to make sure a file exists before blindly reading crap

 * Fixed flag validation for dwarfs (merchants, guards, liasons, corpses should no longer show up in the main list)
 * Fixed skill display for dwarfs 
 * Fixed trait display for dwarfs
 * Fixed current-job display for dwarfs
 * Fixed issue 189. (long/multipart surname reading)
 * Fixed issue 173. (migration waves sort order)
 * Fixed issue 157. (add option for hiding dabbling skills)
 * Made military status names translatable (and made the baby/child search text based instead of using ids)
 * Removed print button since it was just for playing around with
 * Fixed issue 193. (some flags are required to be on a dwarf)
 * Fixed issue 201. (mechanic skill id incorrect)
 
  
RELEASE 0.4.3 (April 4, 2010)

 * Welcome back Athlon owners! Fixed problem running on non-SSE2 processors (Athlon) (Fixed issue 120)
MINOR CHANGES: 
 * You can now have custom professions that have the same name as a default profession, 
   and trying to delete that custom profession (for instance "Miner") will force you to 
   change the profession for all dwarfs that have the custom profession set to "Miner", 
   but not dwarfs whose main default profession is "Miner" (Fixed issue 144)
 * Added AttributeColumns (Fixes issue 122)
 * Added a name completer to the filter box (guesses names based on what's been typed) 
   Searching for characters that don't start a dwarf name still works though. 
 * Added labor cheating option to main options tab (when checked you can set labors on anything) (Fixed issue 125)
BUG FIXES:
 * Fixed Happiness labels (Content has a range of 50 points not 25) (Fixed issue 139)
 * Professions now all have male and female versions of their title (only used for Baron, Count etc...) (Fixed issue 140)

 * Fixed bad drawing of happiness cells (no OS highlight anymore)
 * Attempting to add a Grid view that has been deleted triggers crash (Fixed issue 124)
 * Fixed broken labor sorting (Fixed issue 117)
 * Split "Grid Colors" from "Grid options" section of Options screen (Fixed issue 126)

MINOR CHANGES:
 * DwarfDetailsDock now shows a better default screen on load
BUG FIXES:
 * Fixed showstopper for folks using custom professions (issues 112 and 114) This was a bug
   preventing users from being able to toggle labors for some dwarfs with custom professions set.

RELEASE 0.4.0 (October 3, 2009)

===============================================================================

 * New dwarf details dialog is epic (Fixes issue 95)
MINOR CHANGES:

 * Views now remember selected dwarfs when switching tabs, sort order, or grouping (Fixes issue 108)
 * Added new option for alerting when connection is lost to DF (Fixes issue 102)

 * Options menu is now broken into different tabs with better tooltips for each options (Fixed issue 105)
 * Added a mechanism for HappinessColumn to update itself independent from DwarfModel redraws (much faster)
 * HappinessColumn now draws an aggregate cell that shows the lowest happiness in a group for (eye-catching-ness)

 * There is now a display for total number of dwarfs next to the big number of pending changes display (Fixed issue 100)

 * You can now dump memory for a dwarf to a text dialog (not for general use)
 * Dwarf detail dock now shows attributes as well as a graph for when the next attribute will be gained

BUG FIXES:
 * Fixed color choosers not remembering the last custom color used (Fixed issue 103) 
 * Removed incorrect entries in the non_labor_professions (Fixed issues 87 & 106)
 * Fixed a bug where set re-ordering wasn't being persisted after editing.
 * Fixed a stupid bug where any GridView being changed caused ViewManager to write/read/redraw/write/read/redraw (this took almost 3 seconds in debug builds) Much much faster handling of this now.
 * Fixed a bug where newly added sets were promptly thrown away after accepting the edit dialog :)
 * Fixed a bug in the SpacerColumn ctor that did not explicitly set a width (spacers with a width of -8923232 don't look quite right, BTW)
 * Fixed a bug in the ViewColumn QSettings-based ctor where the column was not being automatically added to the set that was passed in
 * fixed a stupid thing I was doing with the GridViewDock (allowing context menus anywhere on the widget), also added a "new set" action to the GridViewDock's context menu.

 * Added icons to the GridViewDock context menu
 * Fixed a bug where skill columns weren't being drawn in the editor

 * Reworked the XP displays that were broken in the 0.3.2 release (Fixes issue 93)
 * Fixed bug where overridden column background colors weren't being honored (Fixes issue 86)
 * Reverse sort the special column types so that "Spacer" is the default instead of "Happiness" when editing a column set (Fixed issue 90)
 * Fixed crash on windows when launched with option read on start set, and no DF version is running (Fixed issues 84, 99)


RELEASE 0.3.2 (September 13, 2009)
CHANGES SINCE 0.3.1
===============================================================================
MAJOR CHANGES:
	* added support for 40d15 & 40d16 on Windows
	* re-implemented experience display. Tooltips now show experience as: 
	  "current/nextlevel (%progress)" (issue 67)
	* Fixed up tooltips for skill and labor columns to nicely show skills with 
	  true level and experience (issues 75,77)
	* Fixed the window finding issues on XP and Vista (Thanks to Guhndahb and 
	  0x517A5D) 
MINOR CHANGES:
	* Added non-labor setting professions (child, baby, noble etc...) This 
	  should keep users from setting illegal labors (issue 60)
	* tooltips now show the generic translation of a dwarf's name (issues 68, 
	  70, 76)
	* fixed a bug where the translation tables were read despite having 0 values
	  (issues 68, 70, 76)
	* Labor changes not added if Read Dwarves is pressed before Commit Changes 
	  (issue 69)
	* Got rid of both library dependencies on both windows and linux (they are 
	  statically compiled in making building easier)
	* Windows now maps memory segments the same way linux does, this prevents 
	  access violations etc..., making sure we only read known committed 
	  readable memory segments
FEATURE REQUESTS:
 * Added option to show full dwarf names in the options menu (requires 
   re-reading the dwarfs due to caching) (issue 66)
 * added new option to always expand all groups (feature request 83)
 * Enabled labors with no skill in the labor now get a slight boost in sort 
   order. So if you sort a labor by skill, enabled-but-unskilled dwarfs will 
   show just after dabbling dwarves. (feature request 78)
 * Added a new skill drawing method SDM_NUMERIC which draws numbers for the 
   level on the grid (looks good actually) (issues 75,77)
 * Re-did the other SKILL_DRAWING_METHODs to differentiate between 0xp and 
   dabbling. Something is now draw for each of them if skill is over 0exp. 
   (issues 75,77)
 * Skill objects now default to a -1 rating instead of 0 (this was causing a 
   merge between dabbling and 0 experience) (issues 75,77)
 * reworked the dwarf tooltips (show profession in tooltip) (issues 68, 70, 
	 76)
 

RELEASE 0.3.1 (August 19, 2009)
CHANGES SINCE 0.3.0
===============================================================================
 * HappinessColumn tooltip now shows the english version of the happiness level
 * Skills now correctly read experience (Fixed issue 1)
 * fixed issue 58 (can't repro it anymore)
 * Added ability to toggle an entire set at once for a dwarf or a group of 
   dwarfs
 * added support for 40d14
 * (Fixed issue 5): Show skill-ratings legend somewhere
 * Moved the dock config around. Views, Sets, and Skill legend docks are now 
   off by default and can be turned on in a variety of ways. They also default 
   to floating windows that can be docked.
 * (Fixed issue 42): Hangs if game saved/continued without reloading
 * DT now heartbeats every second to DF. It a fort is unloaded or the game 
   exits, DT will disconnect and allow reconnection.
 * (Implemented issue 40): Profession mgmt - separate file/export
 * Fixed a minor drawing bug with selected rows not showing the main grid 
   underneath
 * Fixed a bug where the Viewmanager would try to draw tabs with invalid indexes
 * (Fixed issue 55): Confirm overwrite if View or Set name exists
	 This dialog only pops up when you aren't editing. To prevent accidental 
	 clobbering.
	 Cases where it shows up:
		 Edit View1, change the name to View2(which already exists)
		 New view, change the name to View2(which already exists)
		 Will not show up on edit if the original name was View3 and you save it as 
		   View3.
	 Since it doesn't show up in the general case, I've opted to not implement 
	 the "don't ask me again" checkbox
 * (Fixed issue 54) Blank name is allowed for set name
 * (Fixed issue 53) Main window doesn't show changes after changing group by
 * generic_useless.ini set wasn't correct, so I removed it
 * StateTableView now remembers which rows were expanded and which weren't
 * Setting the group by now goes thru ViewManager so the columns don't get 
   stretched incorrectly 
 * (Fixed issue 57) Dwarf Name column resets to fixed-width
 * (Fixed issue 63) Options Window Duplicates Custom Professions
 * (Fixes issue 61) customizable skill icons
 * (Fixes issue 62) option to turn of shading
 * some minor speedups based on a trial of profiler
 * Dwarf::nice_name() is now cached since it hardly ever changes
 * GameDataReader now caches skill names and skill level names (and uses them)
 * UberDelegate now passes adjusted rectangles by reference to the sub-painters
   for less stack thrashing
 * Less QString::operator+ usage, since it seems to cause reallocations and is
   generally slow as fucking hell
 * Found some spots where build_rows() was being called multiple times and 
   being slow
